Data Science Process is as follows:
1. Collect Data - Quering Databases, Retrieving Files, calling web services, or scraping webpages
2. Prepare Data - [Pre-process](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-preprocessing-in-data-mining/) data to be suitable for model training and testing
3. Train Model - [Feature Vectorization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/prepare-text-data-machine-learning-scikit-learn/), [Feature Scaling](https://towardsdatascience.com/all-about-feature-scaling-bcc0ad75cb35), Tuning/Choosing with various [metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/20-popular-machine-learning-metrics-part-1-classification-regression-evaluation-metrics-1ca3e282a2ce)
, preparing the pipeline 
4. Evaluate Model - Final Test on validation database 
5. Deploy Model - Part of DevOps, training, evaluation and deployment scripts are combined for respective build
5. Retraing the model with fresh data to suit the data environment needs. An iterative step.
